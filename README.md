BU Social App / Helper. BU used to track students around Campus during covid to see which places on campus are populated and which are not. If possible to find a database with info and an API, would be cool to connect information useful to BU students… find which classes are free, maybe see ratemyprof ratings, when bus is coming and more… Could also show people the nearest public bathroom while on campus

Another idea was of Spotify Recommendation app. Not always are the Spotify recommended playlists great, and as a lot of people know, they get repetitive very quickly (the DJ will keep playing the same songs repeat if you play it often enough). And since that is the case we could try to connect to Database of Spotify and through certain filters we could be trying to propose different songs than Spotify is. For example we could be also including in the search how popular the music should be, or find different metrics if possible.

PROPOSAL IDEA:
Gym/Helper App - You sign in / create an account to join the app. The main function is assisting with getting into working out/improving on your current workouts. You would select what "day" it is, ie. what muscle group you want to try and then it will give you a couple exercises that are good for you. Some other factors that it will take into account are how expereinced you are and if you are working out with access to workout equipment (machines/dumbells) or not. Then the app will let you select the ones you wnat to do and track your progress, so you can show you've finished it after each set. Maybe include positive messages when this function is completed to encourage users, or on a timer to help them stay motivated to keep going. 

Global Database instead of per-user data base that stores a large number of API data that was already fetched for PPL (push pull legs)
If someone searches for a unique muscle group you can search for the API and dynamically add it to the Database so that its cached and then each user pulls from that Database.
