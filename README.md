BU Social App / Helper. BU used to track students around Campus during covid to see which places on campus are populated and which are not. If possible to find a database with info and an API, would be cool to connect information useful to BU students… find which classes are free, maybe see ratemyprof ratings, when bus is coming and more… Could also show people the nearest public bathroom while on campus

Another idea was of Spotify Recommendation app. Not always are the Spotify recommended playlists great, and as a lot of people know, they get repetitive very quickly (the DJ will keep playing the same songs repeat if you play it often enough). And since that is the case we could try to connect to Database of Spotify and through certain filters we could be trying to propose different songs than Spotify is. For example we could be also including in the search how popular the music should be, or find different metrics if possible.
